# HardyWeinbergTesting (HW_TEST)

## What is HW_TEST software?

   HW_TEST, a software that can be managed without any difficulties by users with a minimum of programming skills and statistical/mathematical background, is a program that tests the null hypothesis of Hardy-Weinberg proportions using genotype data from autosomal genetic markers with two to twelve alleles.\
**NOTE:** All pertinent computer methods and mathematical/statistical details used in the program are described in the pdf user’s manual, available above.

## How to Install?

  HW_TEST doesn't need to be installed and can be executed directly by clicking the HW_TEST.exe icon within the folder HW_TEST. All files necessary to run the program can be downloaded into the user´s computer by simply clicking "Clone or Download" > "Download ZIP".\
  he program can also be obtained in zipped form and free of charge by email from the authors RBL or PAO (lemes.rb@usp.br or otto@usp.br).\
**NOTE:** The program is executed by simply clicking the HW_TEST.exe file. The main program (HW_TEST.exe) and nine static and dynamic library files (HW_TEST.tkn, vbas31w.sll, vgui31w.sll, voflr31w.sll, vthk31w.dll, vtk1631w.dll, vtk3231w.dll, vvm31w.dll, and vvmt31w.dll) should be inside the folder HW_TEST. Even if the user uses another folder or location to house these files, it is important that they remain inside the same computer location or folder; the absence of any of these files will prevent the program from running.

## Credits

  The original VISUAL BASIC (© Microsoft Inc.) version of HW_TEST was developed by Fernando Bautzer Santos and Paulo A. Otto (Bautzer Santos and Otto, 2005; Bautzer Santos, 2006) and subsequently rewritten and updated by Paulo A. Otto and Renan B. Lemes in Liberty BASIC v. 4.04 (© Shoptalk Systems 1992-2010, www.libertybasic.com), a commercial programming language that runs in Windows Microsoft Operational System.

Feedback from users is welcome and will be used to improve the program and to correct unforeseen flaws. As the program software is free, it comes however with no warranty.

## Acknowledgements

  The adaptation and updating of many parts of the VISUAL BASIC original script algorithms used in the calculations and their rewriting into the LYBERTY BASIC language took place when one of the authors (P. A. Otto) was a visiting professor (2011-2012) at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of Vermont in Burlington VT, United States with a short term fellowship grant from FAPESP. The fellowship (Grant # 2011/10877-1) and the corresponding leave of absence granted by the Genetics Department (IB USP) from the University of Sao Paulo (Brazil) to this author are here formally and deeply acknowledged.
