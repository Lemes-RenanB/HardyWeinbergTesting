# HardyWeinbergTesting (HW_TEST)

## What is HW_TEST software?

   HW_TEST, a software developed for Microsoft Windows that can be managed without any difficulties by users with a minimum of programming skills and statistical/mathematical background, is a program that tests the null hypothesis of Hardy-Weinberg proportions using genotype data from autosomal genetic markers with two to twelve alleles.\
**NOTE:** All pertinent computer methods and mathematical/statistical details used in the program are described in the pdf user’s manual, available above.

## How to download the program?

   All files necessary to run the program can be downloaded into the user´s computer by simply clicking the **Clone or Download** link and then the **Download ZIP** one.\
  The program can also be obtained in zipped form and free of charge by email from the authors Renan B. Lemes (lemes.rb@usp.br) or Paulo A. Otto (otto@usp.br).\
**NOTE:** The unzipping of the downloaded "HardyWeinbergTesting-master.zip" file inside any location of the user's computer will result in the creation of a folder named "HardyWeinbergTesting-master" in the same location. This folder contains the user's pdf guide, the source code of the program and the folder HW_TEST. The program is executed by simply clicking the HW_TEST.exe executable file inside this folder HW_TEST. The main exe program, a tkn (tokenized) file and eight static and dynamic library files (HW_TEST.exe, HW_TEST.tkn, vbas31w.sll, vgui31w.sll, voflr31w.sll, vthk31w.dll, vtk1631w.dll, vtk3231w.dll, vvm31w.dll, and vvmt31w.dll) should be inside the folder HW_TEST. Even if another folder or location to house these files other than the folder HW_TEST is used, it is important that they remain inside the same computer location or folder; the absence of any of these files, that should always be kept physically together, will prevent the program from running.

## Credits

  The original VISUAL BASIC (© Microsoft Inc.) version of HW_TEST was developed by Fernando A. B. Santos and Paulo A. Otto (Santos and Otto, 2005; Santos, 2006) and subsequently rewritten and updated by Paulo A. Otto and Renan B. Lemes in Liberty BASIC v. 4.04 (© Shoptalk Systems 1992-2010, www.libertybasic.com), a programming language that runs in Windows Microsoft Operational System.
